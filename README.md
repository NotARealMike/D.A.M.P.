Game made for the Cambridge Computer Lab Game Gig One Button Edition.

The player is a disc in a 2D world. It has a hook that's rotating
about it. Whenever you press a button (any button), the hook will fly
out into the direction it's pointing and attach itself to the first
object in that way. The player will then fly to the hook, dealing
damage along the way.

There are static pillars and moving boxes to aid the player in moving
around, and to provide smooth bouncy fun.

The game gets progressively harder, as enemies spawn faster and
faster. See how high a score you can get!
